## Course Description

React Native is a powerful framework that allows us to build fully native applications for iOS and Android with just one JavaScript codebase. Mobile development provides unique and interesting opportunities and challenges in application design and features. In this course we will explore the fundamental building blocks of a React Native application, how to fetch and display data, navigate between screens, persist user data across app launches and plenty more.
